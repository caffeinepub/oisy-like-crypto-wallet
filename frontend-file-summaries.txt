{
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app with TanStack Router, AuthLayout guard that checks subscription status via `useIsSubscribed` and redirects unsubscribed users to `/subscription`, whitelist migration on startup, and a new `/subscription` route pointing to `SubscriptionPage`.",
  "frontend/src/components/GlassCard.tsx": "Reusable glassmorphism card component with optional `style` prop (now added), raised/hover variants, and dark-theme styling via CSS classes.",
  "frontend/src/pages/SendPage.tsx": "Multi-step send page updated with an ICP address format sub-selector (Native Account ID vs ICRC Token Principal ID) when ICP network is selected, filtered whitelist picker per sub-type, per-type address validation with inline error messages, and `icpAddressType` recorded in transaction history.",
  "frontend/src/pages/TransactionHistoryPage.tsx": "Transaction history page displaying all recorded send intents with status badges, search/filter, per-record deletion, and clear-all; shows ERC-20 token symbol and contract address when present.",
  "frontend/src/utils/addressDerivation.ts": "Utility module for deriving ICP account address (principal text) and EVM-compatible address (SHA-256 hash of principal, last 20 bytes as 0x-prefixed hex) from a Principal, plus a truncateAddress helper.",

  "frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx": "Dashboard page using correct deriveICPAddress/deriveEVMAddress imports (async EVM derivation via useEffect), showing ICP and EVM address cards, native token portfolio (ICP/ETH/USDC, no BTC), dynamic ERC-20 tokens section from walletStorage, and quick action buttons.",
  "frontend/src/pages/NetworksPage.tsx": "Networks page using correct deriveICPAddress/deriveEVMAddress imports with async EVM derivation via useEffect, showing each network's address and ERC-20 tokens list for EVM networks.",
  "frontend/src/lib/walletStorage.ts": "Extended wallet localStorage utilities with updated `WhitelistEntry` type using `'icp-native' | 'icp-token' | 'evm'`, address validation functions (`validateIcpNativeAddress`, `validateIcpTokenAddress`, `validateEvmAddress`), a `migrateWhitelistEntries` migration helper, and an optional `icpAddressType` field on `TransactionRecord`.",
  "frontend/src/pages/TokensPage.tsx": "ERC-20 tokens management page with a table showing symbol, name, network, contract address, and balance; supports adding tokens (with balance field) via a dialog and editing balances inline via a separate dialog.",

  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for user profile, subscription management, and whitelist migration. The `useVerifyAndActivateSubscription` mutation now correctly handles all backend result variants (`ok`, `alreadySubscribed`, `blockNotFound`, `invalidBlock`, `insufficientAmount`, `wrongAddress`, `exceedsMaximumSubscriptionTime`) via a `parseVerifyResult` helper, throwing descriptive errors for each failure case instead of incorrectly checking for a non-existent `'err'` kind.",
  "frontend/src/pages/SubscriptionPage.tsx": "Subscription management page implementing Plan A (manual ICP transfer + block index verification). Fixes the \"Verify & Activate\" button by replacing the shadcn Checkbox with a native `<input type=\"checkbox\">` (eliminating the `onCheckedChange` wiring issue), clearing `blockIndexError` on every keystroke so `canSubmit` evaluates correctly, and rendering the submit button as a plain `<button>` with explicit inline styles for enabled/disabled states — ensuring it is visually enabled and clickable whenever a block index is entered and ToS is accepted."
