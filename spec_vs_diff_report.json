  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/pages/SubscriptionPage.tsx along with supporting files. The SubscriptionPage.tsx file is truncated in the diff, so full verification of all acceptance criteria is limited. Based on what is visible, the file imports new icons (Hash, Info) suggesting UI additions consistent with helper text or tooltip implementation. The file-summaries.txt does not explicitly describe the label or helper text changes in SubscriptionPage.tsx. The truncation prevents full confirmation of all AC items.",
