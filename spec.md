# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Block Index input field on the SubscriptionPage to use clearer, more descriptive labeling so users understand what value to enter after completing an ICP transfer.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the "Block Index" label with descriptive text such as "Transaction Index in ICP Ledger" (derived from "The index of the transaction in the ICP ledger.")
- Update the input placeholder to reflect the new descriptive label
- Add helper text beneath the input clarifying that this value can be found in the user's ICP wallet transaction history (e.g. NNS App, ICP Dashboard)

**User-visible outcome:** Users on the SubscriptionPage now see a clearly labeled input field that explains exactly what value to enter when verifying their ICP subscription payment, reducing confusion after completing a transfer.
